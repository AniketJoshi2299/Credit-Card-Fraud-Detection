# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Description
A machine learning model built using Logistic Regression in Python to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The model processes features like transaction amount, location, and others to identify fraudulent activities.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Handled imbalanced datasets using Random Undersampling for improved fraud detection.
Modeling: Developed a Logistic Regression model to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using Precision, Recall, and Accuracy metrics for reliable detection.

## Technologies Used
Python: For machine learning implementation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-Learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
